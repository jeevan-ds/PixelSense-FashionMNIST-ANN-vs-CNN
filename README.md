# PixelSense-Fashion-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
PixelSense is a deep learning project focused on classifying grayscale fashion images into predefined apparel categories using neural networks. The project compares a baseline Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to highlight the importance of spatial feature learning in image classification tasks.The dataset used is **Fashion-MNIST**, which contains 28×28 grayscale images across 10 clothing categories.

##  Objectives
- Build a baseline ANN model using flattened pixel values
- Develop a CNN to capture spatial features from images
- Compare model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Demonstrate why CNNs outperform ANNs for image-based tasks
